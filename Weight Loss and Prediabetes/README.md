# Weight Loss and Prediabetes
## This is a story about a data visualization I created with my own, self-generated medical data. The visualization was simple (an Excel spreadsheet) but the medical consequences were profound.

### I havd been overweight and prediabetic for years; I entered my weight and fasting blood sugar (FBS) daily into a spreadsheet. Last year I resolved to lose weight and in doing so, lower my blood glucose (decrease in the latter following weight loss is long-documented in the medical literature.) Over the course of ten months, I achieved a voluntary weight loss of over 10 percent, enough to trigger a drop in my blood glucose. However, my simple line chart of the two variables clearly showed by visual inspection alone that the blood glucose was failing to come down. In fact, from roughly January of this year, it seemed to increase slightly.

### Although I was asymptomatic, I became alarmed that something was wrong with my pancreas, possibly cancer. I obtained an ultrasound; the results were suspicious. Further investigation confirmed the presence of a small tumor. 

### Eventually I had surgery, subtotal pancreatectomy of the body and tail of my pancreas (about 80% of the organ.) The tumor was unusually small for its location (2.5 cm; tumors in that location are usually 5â€”7 cm.) It was pre-malignant, rather than malignant: there was no spread anywhere. Post-op scanning three months afterward has shown no evidence of recurrence.

### The spreadsheet and its chart are available for review here.
