# Weight Loss and Prediabetes
## This is a story about a data visualization I created with my own, self-generated medical data. The visualization was simple (an Excel spreadsheet) but the medical consequences were profound.

### I had been overweight and prediabetic for years; I entered my weight and fasting blood sugar (FBS) daily into a spreadsheet. Last year I resolved to lose weight and thereby lower my blood glucose (decrease in glucose following weight loss is well-documented in the medical literature.) Over the course of ten months, I achieved a voluntary weight loss of over 10 percent, which should have caused a decrease in the blood glucose. However, my simple line chart clearly showed by visual inspection alone that the blood glucose was failing to come down; in fact, from roughly January of this year it seemed to increase slightly.

### Although I was asymptomatic, I became alarmed that something was wrong with my pancreas, possibly cancer. I obtained an ultrasound; the results were suspicious. Further investigation confirmed the presence of a tumor. 

### Eventually I had surgery, subtotal pancreatectomy of the body and tail of my pancreas. The tumor was unusually small for its location (2.5 cm; tumors in that location are usually 5â€”7 cm.) It was pre-malignant, rather than malignant, also unusual: there was no spread anywhere. Post-op scanning three months afterward has shown no evidence of recurrence.

### This remarkable event and its history seem to me worthy of sharing. The spreadsheet and its chart are available for review here.
